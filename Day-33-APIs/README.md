# APIs
The project highlights API endpoint usage. In the course of the project, we use 
The _sunrise and sunset API_ together with _ISS current location API_ to send email to ourselves of the 
passing Iss so we can look up into the sky and observe it.    
We also consumed _kanye quotes API_ to get random quotes as in the `kanye_quotes.py` file
