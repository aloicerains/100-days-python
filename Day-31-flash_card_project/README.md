# Flash Card Project
The project helps in learning new language, i.e. French to English words. A random French word is given and the user is 
expected to translate it. For every correct translation, the user marks correct, while for every wrong translation, the 
user marks wrong. The correct translations are eliminated from the list. This allows the user more time to concentrate on
the unknown words
